# Durable intake operator contract

`python -m tools.intake.cli --root ROOT` operates one private installed instance.
Initialize the intake ledger explicitly; stage exact UTF-8 JSON, then run only a
named stage. The ledger is operational recovery state, never corpus authority.

- Request v1: `version`, `correlation_id`, nullable `correction_of`, `policy`
  (`version`, `sha256`), `retry` (`max_attempts`, `backoff_seconds`), and `stages`.
  Each stage has `id`, `kind`, `operation`, `arguments`. Closed fields, duplicate
  key refusal, 1 MiB request limit, 16 stages, 1–10 attempts, 0–86400s backoff.
- Fixed adapters: receipt/catalog-submit; extraction/docling-prepare,
  docling-verify, docling-register; review/review-append;
  publication/index-build; return/await-ack. See `tools/intake/contracts.py` for
  argument fields. Preserve native attribution and original concurrency tokens.
- Intake stores exact requests before effects. Prepared intent commits before
  an execution attempt. Restart reconciles unfinished attempts without charging
  another attempt. Catalog/review retries use original request IDs and verified
  native backups; evidence records original committed revisions, not current
  unrelated revisions. Docling reruns the offline native lifecycle, binding
  source/runtime/rendition identity; no auto-review or selection. Intake passes
  the pinned identity to the native lifecycle as `expected_identity`, so a
  source or runtime change refuses before any rendition or registration is
  published and each attempt converts once.
- Publication pins manifest bytes, source hashes and native metadata/freshness.
  A matching fresh publication can reconcile without rebuilding. Input drift
  blocks; correction requires a new linked request, not refreshed replay tokens.
  Intake passes `index.build` an optional `publication_guard` callback, which the
  native builder invokes inside the publication lock immediately before
  atomically replacing the destination; a raising guard preserves the prior
  index. Inspection reports current availability separately from historical
  completion, including when a published index later becomes unreadable.
- Undecodable or invalid native inputs block durably with a recorded attempt
  outcome instead of surfacing a traceback, and ledger write failures after
  validation report an unavailable ledger rather than claiming corruption.
- Retryable failures record eligibility time; nothing sleeps or schedules itself.
  `replay` explicitly resets a blocked/dead-letter stage's bounded cycle while
  retaining exact request, intent and all attempt/replay history. Other requests
  remain runnable. Unfinished work is resumed with `run`/`resume`, not replay.
- Return requires a complete root-relative disposition artifact and its SHA-256.
  `run` records `return-pending`. `acknowledge` accepts only matching
  `delivery_correlation`, `disposition_sha256`, `transport_receipt`; exact repeats
  are idempotent and changed receipts conflict. `delivered` is a supplied
  transport acknowledgment claim, not independent remote or business acceptance.
- `.local/intake` is 0700; database/lock are 0600, symlink-free, LINT schema 1,
  FULL synchronous SQLite with process serialization. Missing/incompatible or
  corrupt ledgers refuse operation; never rebuild corpus authority from this
  ledger. Protect operational request bodies like other private instance data.

## Manual upload and local drop

`submit-file FILE --submission-id ID --format {text,gemini-txt,odt,pdf,image}
--actor A --reason R` stages one explicitly supplied file. Optional
`--name`, `--correction-of`, `--expected-sha256` and declared
`--origin-system/--origin-locator/--origin-version`.

- The file is read once through a symlink-free, regular-file-only descriptor and
  refused if it changes during the read, exceeds the existing extractor limit, or
  fails the extension/signature check for an already supported format.
- Bytes and a hash-bound `submission.json` provenance sidecar are atomically
  published (0600 in 0700 directories) under
  `<first original root>/intake/<submission-id>/`, then registered as source,
  receipt, original and preserved-metadata records through a durable
  `catalog-submit` stage with correlation `upload-<submission-id>`.
- The acknowledgment reports `receipt` (committed, pending, retryable, blocked,
  dead-letter) separately from `processing`; upload never extracts, reviews,
  selects or qualifies anything.
- A filename never supplies a remote identity or version; only declared origin
  fields do (`identity_basis`). Equal bytes under distinct submissions remain
  distinct sources and receipts.
- An exact retry returns the existing acknowledgment and resumes unfinished
  work. Changed bytes or descriptor under one submission ID are a
  `submission_conflict`; send a new submission with `--correction-of`, which
  reuses the parent source and adds a `version-of` relationship.
- `drop-scan --drop DIR` is discovery only. `drop-submit --drop DIR` submits each
  `NAME` paired with `NAME.submission.json` (the v1 descriptor fields). The drop
  must exist and contain `.librarian-drop`; a missing or unmarked mount is
  `drop_unavailable`, never an empty success. Drop contents are never modified.

No acquisition, connector, scheduler, automatic review/selection, migration,
model service or return transport is supplied by this interface.
